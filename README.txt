Before running the python script run:
	pip install psycopg2 (if on windows)
	pip3 install psycopg2

Might cause error while running installing pip. 
	This link is helpful to fix it: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23708898/pip-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command
	OR
	Try running "pip install psycopg2-binary", not sure if this works but might work.

To run the script:
	py database.py (in the directory the script is in.)
